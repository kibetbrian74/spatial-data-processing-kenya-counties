# 📍 Spatial Data Analysis for Kenya Counties

This repository contains a simple but complete geospatial workflow for processing and visualizing Kenya county boundaries using GeoPandas, Matplotlib, and supporting Python libraries.
The notebook demonstrates how to:

o Load and inspect spatial data

o Clean county names

o Plot the national counties map

o Generate individual county maps

o Produce a population density visualization

o Save outputs to organized folders

This makes the project suitable for GIS beginners, data analysts, and researchers working with spatial data in Python.
